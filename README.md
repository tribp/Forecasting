# Forecasting
Mini course on the forecasting ecosystem for Time Series

**Goal:** 

- Explain the different forecasting approaches within the three main families:
    - Statistical methods
    - Classical machine learning methods
    - Deep learning methods
- Provide hands-on examples using:
    - A classical dataset, such as AirPassengers
    - Real-world energy data

**TOC:**

1) Statistical methods
    1.1 ARIMA family
    1.2 Prophet (by Meta)
2) Machine learning methods
    2.1 XGBoost
    2.2 LightGBM
3) Deep learning methods
    3.1 LSTM based
    3.2 Transformers based
    3.3 NeuralForecast
    3.4 Foundationla models (eg: Time GPT)
